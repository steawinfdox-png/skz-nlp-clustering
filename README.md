# Unsupervised Emotional Clustering and Visualization of Stray Kids' Discography
An end-to-end NLP pipeline that analyzes the music artist, Stray Kids' entire 7-year Korean discography (scraped from Genius API) by clustering English-translated lyrics into emotional themes using TF-IDF vectorization and unsupervised learning through K-Means. This project auto-generates interpretable cluster labels using a Groq-hosted LLM, builds a emotional timeline over the group's career from 2018-2025, and visualizes thematic trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
